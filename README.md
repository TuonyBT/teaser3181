Find a value p<100 such that:
1) there are at least two Pythagorean triplets (x, y, z); x + y + z = p
2) p can be expressed as b.(a+b) where a, b are odd and share no prime factors; b > a
3) p can be expressed as the perimeter of a spherical section with radius r and azimuthal angle theta, such that r and theta (to the nearest degree) each have two digits which are interchanged
